# Continuously develop and deliver by using a toolchain

With a toolchain, you can create a GitHub repository that deploys to Bluemix automatically through a delivery pipeline.
Then, you can modify the code that runs in your app by pushing changes to the GitHub repository.
{:shortdesc}

1. To get started, on the app's Overview page, click Add Toolchain.

2. Review the default information for the toolchain settings. If needed, update the settings.

3. In the Web IDE or in your favorite editor, update the code.

4. Push your changes. The updated app is redeployed to Bluemix.
