-  In the terminal, you are notified when updates to the `ibmcloud` CLI and plug-ins are available. Be sure to keep your CLI up-to-date so that you can use all the available commands and flags.
-   To see whether {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is available, [check the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} status page ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=status).
-   From the console, check if you have any relevant **Notifications** ![Notifications icon](../icons/Notification_PUP.svg "Notifications icon").
-   Contact IBM Support by opening a case. To learn about opening an IBM support case, or about support levels and case severities, see [Contacting support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support#getting-customer-support).
When you report an issue, include your cluster ID. To get your cluster ID, run `ibmcloud ks clusters`.
